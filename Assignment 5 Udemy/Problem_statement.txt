Below code is from the previous demonstration. It uses the reduce method that takes 3 parameters. 

Re-implement it so that the reduce method would take only 2 parameters, i.e., second overloaded reduce method and it should still return a StringBuilder.

StringBuilder concat = Arrays.stream(grades)
        .reduce(new StringBuilder(),
                              (sb, s) -> sb.append(s),
                              (sb1, sb2) -> sb1.append(sb2));

Hint: You would use an intermediate operation before the reduce() method as part of the re-implementation.
